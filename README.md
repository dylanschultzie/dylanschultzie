### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dylan, but please call me `schultzie`.

I'm a believer in leaving a codebase in a better place than when you started using it, and you can 
[see](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/pull/901) 
[that](https://github.com/polkachu/cosmos-validators/pull/27) 
[throughout](https://github.com/blockpane/tenderduty/pull/32) 
[my](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/pull/685) 
[git](https://github.com/eve-network/eve/pull/1) 
[history](https://github.com/Reecepbcups/cosmos-balance-bot/pull/5). 
I've found this to be the best way to make improvements and meaningful changes - small bits at a time.
This applies to all aspects of life - you *can* do all the dishes in one fel swoop, but that requires 
commitment. Instead, doing them in increments makes it feel not overwhelming and manageable.
